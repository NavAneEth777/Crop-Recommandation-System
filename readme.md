# Crop Recommendation System
## Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based Crop Recommendation System that provides tailored crop suggestions to farmers based on various environmental and soil conditions. By analyzing historical data and utilizing predictive models, the system aims to optimize crop yields and enhance agricultural profitability.

# Features
* Input Data Collection: Collects essential data like soil type, climate, rainfall, temperature, humidity, and pH levels.
* Data Preprocessing: Prepares data for model training by handling missing values, normalization, and feature transformation.
* Machine Learning Models: Employs algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, SVM, and gradient boosting for accurate predictions.
* Model Training and Evaluation: Trains models on historical data and evaluates performance using relevant metrics.
* Crop Recommendation: Provides crop recommendations based on input parameters and trained models.
* User-Friendly Interface: Offers an intuitive interface for data input, recommendation viewing, and additional information.
# Technologies
* Python: Core programming language for model development, data processing, and web application.
* Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training, evaluation, and prediction.
* Pandas: Data manipulation library for data preprocessing and analysis.
* NumPy: Library for numerical operations on arrays.
* Flask: Web framework for building the user interface and handling HTTP requests.
* HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages for web interface design.
* JavaScript: Scripting language for client-side interactions and UI enhancements.
# Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/NavAneEth777/Crop-Recommandation-System.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python app.py`
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`
# Usage
1. Provide soil type, climate data, and other relevant information through the user interface.
2. The system processes the input and generates crop recommendations.
3. Explore additional details about recommended crops and their suitability.
# Future Enhancements
* Integration of real-time weather data for improved accuracy.
* Incorporation of crop market prices and profitability analysis.
* Development of a mobile application for convenient access.
* Continuous improvement through user feedback and data collection.
